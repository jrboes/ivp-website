## What is Coaching?
Coaching is about assisting an individual in uncovering their truth. All the answers reside within us but it is difficult to see ourselves objectively. I am about assisting you in discovering your authentic self and uncovering your inner power. With your power that is felt in your self-esteem, self-respect and love, you can have an amazing life that matches who you are. That feels right. A life where you do not lose yourself when the world throws you a curve.

I love coaching people who are willing to sit and look introspectively at what is going on in their subconscious and also to examine conscious thoughts that are taken for granted. I love looking at our differences and our similarities. Seeing how our similarities can help each other and how our differences demonstrate where we have our power.

## What We Explore Together:
- Dream analysis to bring out awareness of different parts of your personality.
- Archetypal patterns that reveal your unique strengths and power.
- Beliefs that affect your relationships, boundaries, and responsibilities.
- Mindfulness practices to increase awareness to understand what's happening inside you.
- The blocks that keep you from deep love and joy.

**How I Help:** I help you gain a new perspective to approach each life situation differently. My objective is to help you bring out your authentic self to live in your power with freedom and joy. My premise of understanding is based on the fact that we are all worthy and loving at your core.

## Techniques I Use

**Psychosynthesis**  
Working with our sub-Personalities to see and understand our beliefs through emotions. The sub-personalities reside in the sub-conscious and in a sense, acting out our beliefs. By examining them, we bring our beliefs into the light for examination. From there, we choose if we want to keep the belief or release it.

**Archetypes**  
Archetypes are universal patterns in the collective unconscious. We are all a part of forming and maintaining these patterns, and these patterns can change over time.  

Knowing the archetypes that work strongest in us gives us insights into where our power lies. We have strengths we are not aware of. Strengths when used can open up worlds of opportunity. 

**Dream Analysis**  
Dream analysis brings out different parts of our personality. We can recognize different parts of our personality when we say we are of two minds or when we say part of me thinks this but another part of me thinks that. These are from conflicting beliefs that are sometimes very difficult to sort out. But once sorted, it gives clarity and the path to move forward.

**Mindfulness**  
Mindfulness helps us learn what is going on inside of us. What are our beliefs and thoughts? How do these conflict with each other? How is what we believe and therefore do influenced by our culture, our family? How much of us is influenced by the collective consciousness?
